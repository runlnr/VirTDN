This is a project where my team planned on maping the Tran Dai Nghia high school for the gifted into Unity Game Engine and implement a little bit of movement into it using C# and this is how it turned out.

Dev log:
27.05.24: Imported the exterior of E Block into the engine, as also applying colisions.
30.05.24: Finished the implementation of character movement into the game.
